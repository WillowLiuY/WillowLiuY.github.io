                    <h2>Unsupervised Video Object Tracking in Highly Dynamic Environments</h2>
                    <p>Our focus is to improve learning-based localization and tracking performance in environments where dynamics like moving or temporarily static objects often cause system failures. We developed a dynamic object tracking system that adapts to new environments without pre-defined object classes. This flexibility is important for applications like autonomous navigation where conditions change rapidly.</p>

                        <li><strong>Bi-directional Mask Propagation:</strong> We further improved the accuracy by using forward and backward motion analysis to maintain consistency across sequences.</li>

                    <h2>Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Indoor Scene Understanding</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I designed a segmentation network for indoor scenes using only image-level labels - simpler to collect but lacking detailed object locations and sizes. This challenge was addressed by developing a robust approach to semantic segmentation that reduces reliance on expensive pixel-level annotations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Project Highlights:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weekly Supervised Learning:</strong> This method uses minimalistic image-level labels to outline the presence of object classes within an image. They are easy to gather in large amounts at low-cost, compared to pixel-level annotations that are commonly used in segmentation training. To compensate for the absence of detailed object location and boundaries, prior knowledge from 3D building models are used to guide the network.

This adaptation significantly improved performance in segmenting indoor scenes by using spatial information from 3D models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Class Activation Mapping (CAM):</strong> Employed CAM to generate initial object regions, refined further with edge and size data from 3D models (Building Information Models (BIM) in this project). </li>

                        <li><strong>Specialized Loss Function:</strong> Crafted a customized cross-entropy loss function that integrates location priors from 3D models, allowing the network to produce more accurate segmentation masks even with limited supervision.</li>
